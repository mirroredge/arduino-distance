# Arduino Distance
Arduino based distance display. Was originally created to be used as display to know when to stop pulling into a garage. It uses a Sparkfun Pro Micro 5v, 7 Segment LCD display, Ultrasonic Distance Detector, and 5 neopixels. The Ultrasonic distance sensor polls the area for incoming objects (It has a 20ft maximum distance) As an object is detected and is moving in the 7 Segment LCD displays the distance in inches, while also changing the neopixel color. The neopixels slowly fade from green to red as the object gets closer. There are also a few software based enhancements to the hardware. A sleep mode is enabled in this project, where if the distance has not changed by a sufficient amount in a reasonable amount of time the neopixels and display will turn off. The distance sensor will also poll at a reduced rate. There is also built in smoothing of the distance sensor to provide more consistent results from the raw readings.
